# Security Policy

## Overview

This project provides MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for managing homelab infrastructure. Because it interacts with critical infrastructure components (containers, DNS, network devices, AI models), security is paramount.

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Configuration Security

#### Environment Variables
- **NEVER commit `.env` files** to version control
- Use `.env.example` as a template
- Generate unique API keys for each service
- Rotate API keys regularly (recommended: every 90 days)
- Use strong, randomly-generated API keys (minimum 32 characters)

#### Ansible Inventory
- **NEVER commit `ansible_hosts.yml`** with real infrastructure details
- Use `ansible_hosts.example.yml` as a template
- Keep production inventory files outside the git repository
- Use Ansible Vault for sensitive variables in production

#### Project Instructions
- **NEVER commit `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** with real infrastructure details
- Use `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.example.md` as a template
- Customize with your actual infrastructure only in your local environment

### Network Security

#### Docker/Podman APIs
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING**

Docker and Podman APIs accessed by this project use **unencrypted HTTP connections** and typically have **no authentication** by default.

**Required Security Measures:**
1. **NEVER expose Docker/Podman APIs to the internet**
2. **Use firewall rules** to restrict API access to trusted networks only
3. **Consider using SSH tunneling** for remote access
4. **Enable TLS with client certificates** (mTLS) in production
5. **Use Docker socket proxy** (like tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy) to limit API access

**Firewall Configuration Example (Linux):**
```bash
# Allow only from local network
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2375 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2375 -j DROP
```

#### Pi-hole API Security
1. **Generate unique API keys** for each Pi-hole instance
   - Pi-hole Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí Generate new API key
2. **NEVER reuse API keys** between environments
3. **Store keys in `.env` file only** - never hardcode in scripts
4. **Use HTTPS** when accessing Pi-hole remotely
5. **Limit API key permissions** if possible in future Pi-hole versions

#### Unifi Controller Security
1. **Use dedicated API key** with minimal required permissions
2. **Enable 2FA** on Unifi controller admin account
3. **Restrict controller access** to management VLAN
4. **Keep controller software updated**
5. **Use HTTPS only** for controller access

#### Ollama/LiteLLM Security
1. **Do not expose Ollama ports** to the internet
2. **Use authentication** on LiteLLM proxy (if exposed externally)
3. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
4. **Monitor for unusual API usage**
5. **Keep models and software updated**

### Access Control

#### MCP Server Access
- MCP servers run with **Claude Desktop's privileges**
- They have **file system access** to the MCP directory
- They can **execute system commands** (unifi_exporter.py subprocess)
- They can **make network requests** to configured services

**Security Implications:**
- **Limit file write permissions** in MCP Registry Inspector
- **Validate all file paths** to prevent directory traversal
- **Sanitize command arguments** to prevent injection
- **Use minimal network permissions**

#### Principle of Least Privilege
1. **Docker API**: Consider using read-only API proxy
2. **Ansible**: Use read-only inventory queries only
3. **MCP Registry Inspector**: Restrict write access to MCP directory only
4. **Network access**: Firewall rules to limit connections

### Data Protection

#### Sensitive Data Handling
**Never include in code or logs:**
- API keys and passwords
- Private IP addresses (in public repositories)
- Internal hostnames
- Network topology details
- User credentials
- Authentication tokens

**Safe Data Storage:**
- Use environment variables (`.env` file)
- Use Ansible Vault for sensitive playbook variables
- Use secrets management tools (HashiCorp Vault, etc.) in production
- Encrypt backups containing configuration files

#### Logging Security
Current implementation logs to `stderr`. Be aware that logs may contain:
- API endpoints (URLs)
- Host information
- Error messages with partial data

**Recommendations:**
- Review logs before sharing for troubleshooting
- Implement log sanitization for sensitive data
- Use log rotation to prevent disk filling
- Secure log files with appropriate permissions

### Code Security

#### Input Validation
The project implements basic input validation, but you should:
1. **Validate port numbers** (1-65535 range)
2. **Sanitize file paths** (prevent directory traversal)
3. **Validate hostnames** (prevent DNS rebinding)
4. **Check API response sizes** (prevent memory exhaustion)

#### Subprocess Security
The Unifi exporter uses subprocess calls:
```python
# CURRENT: API key visible in process list
cmd = ['python', 'script.py', '--api-key', KEY]

# BETTER: Use environment variables
env['UNIFI_API_KEY'] = KEY
cmd = ['python', 'script.py']
```

**Known Issue**: API keys may be visible in process listings. Consider passing via environment instead.

#### Dependency Security
- Keep Python dependencies updated: `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`
- Monitor for security advisories in dependencies
- Use `pip-audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions in `requirements.txt`

### Transport Security

#### API Communication
Current implementation uses **HTTP** (unencrypted) for all API calls:
- Docker/Podman APIs
- Ollama APIs
- Pi-hole APIs
- Unifi Controller API (depends on configuration)

**For Production:**
1. **Enable TLS/HTTPS** on all services
2. **Validate SSL certificates** (set `verify=True` in aiohttp)
3. **Use certificate pinning** for critical services
4. **Implement mTLS** for Docker API

#### Network Isolation
**Recommended VLAN Structure:**
- Management VLAN: MCP client, Ansible controller
- Services VLAN: Docker hosts, Ollama, Pi-hole
- IoT VLAN: Unifi devices (separate from services)
- Guest VLAN: Isolated from management and services

openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca-key.pem -sha256 -out ca.pem

# Configure Docker daemon
{
  "tls": true,
  "tlscacert": "/etc/docker/ca.pem",
  "tlscert": "/etc/docker/server-cert.pem",
  "tlskey": "/etc/docker/server-key.pem",
  "hosts": ["tcp://0.0.0.0:2376"]
