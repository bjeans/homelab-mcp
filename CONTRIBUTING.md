3. **Make your changes:**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add/update tests if applicable
   - Update documentation as needed
4. **Test thoroughly** with real infrastructure
5. **Run security check:** `python pre_publish_check.py`

## Development Setup

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/homelab-mcp
cd homelab-mcp

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your test environment details

# Install git hook (recommended)
python install_git_hook.py
```

### Testing

Before submitting a PR:

```bash
# Run security checker
python pre_publish_check.py

# Test with your homelab
# Update .env with test credentials
python ansible_mcp_server.py  # Test individual servers
python docker_mcp_podman.py
# etc.
```

### Adding a New MCP Server

1. Create the server file (e.g., `my_service_mcp.py`)
2. Follow the existing pattern from other servers
3. Add configuration to `.env.example`
4. Update `README.md` with server documentation
5. Update `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.example.md`
6. Update `CLAUDE.example.md` if adding AI development context
7. Add security notes if the service uses API keys
8. Test thoroughly

### Code Style

- **Python 3.10+** features
- **Async/await** for I/O operations
- **Type hints** where beneficial
- **Error handling** for network operations
- **Logging to stderr** for debugging
- **Security first:** Validate inputs, sanitize outputs

### Security Requirements

**Critical:**
- ‚ùå Never hardcode credentials or API keys
- ‚ùå Never commit real IP addresses or hostnames
- ‚úÖ Always use environment variables for secrets
- ‚úÖ Always validate user inputs
- ‚úÖ Run `pre_publish_check.py` before committing
